# """Setup keepass wrapper script and variable to ease use of keepassxc-cli
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   Install a symlink from `.direnv/src/keepass.sh` to `.direnv/bin/keepass` to
#   be able to use script wrapper as keepass command. Also export some required
#   variable used by the script. Finally ensure that exported variables are
#   valid, i.e. the keepass database can be unlocked using keepass keyfile.
#
#   REMARK: Keepass script require a keepass database that is unlocked by a
#   file, not by a password !
#
#   Parameters in `.envrc.ini` are:

#   | Name               | Description                                                                                             |
#   | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
#   | `KEEPASS_DB`       | Absolute path to a keepassxc database                                                                   |
#   | `KEEPASS_KEYFILE`  | Absolute path to a file to unlock keepassxc database                                                    |
#   | `KEEPASS_NAME`     | (optional) Explicit name for the database, like `perso`, `pro`, etc., which can be used in your prompt  |
#
#   </center>
#
#   ## Parameters
#
#   ### `KEEPASS_DB`
#
#   Absolute path to a keepassxc database, you can use `~`, `${HOME}` or even
#   `${DIRENV_ROOT}` to define path relatively. The database cannot be unlocked
#   with password when using script `keepass.sh`, be sure to configure it to be
#   unlocked using file.
#
#   ### `KEEPASS_KEYFILE`
#
#   Absolute path to the file that unlock the keepass database defined in
#   `KEEPASS_DB`.
#
#   ### `KEEPASS_NAME`
#
#   An explicit name, like `perso`, `pro`, etc. Useless for script `keepass.sh`.
#   It is export only to be used in your prompt (like in `PS1`). If not set,
#   value of this variable will be the filename of the `KEEPASS_DB`.

#   ## `.envrc.ini` example
#
#   Corresponding entry in `.envrc.ini.template` are:
#
#   ```ini
#   # Keepass module
#   # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   # Set keepassxc environment variable to be able to use the keepassxc-cli wrapper
#   # provided in `.direnv/src/keepass.sh`.
#   [keepass]
#   # Specify the path to the keypass database
#   KEEPASS_DB=/path/to/keepass.db
#   # Specify the path to the keyfile unlocking the keepass database
#   KEEPASS_KEYFILE=/another/path/to/keyfile
#   # Specify an explicit name in an environment variable to be able to use it in
#   # your shell prompt.
#   KEEPASS_NAME=Perso
#   ```
