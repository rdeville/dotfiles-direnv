# .envrc

File that trigger `direnv` when entering a folder

## Description

THIS SCRIPT CAN ONLY BE USED WITH 'direnv' PROGRAM

[Direnv](https://direnv.net/) is a tool allowing to automatically call a
specific script (.envrc) when entering or leaving a directory.
In short, once configured and allow, you will have no command to type, after
going to your working directory.

If you are using `direnv`, when entering a folder with this script, you
might see following error:
```
direnv: error /path/to/.envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its
content
```

This means you have to review its content with your favorite editor (vim
here as example):
```
vim .envrc
```

If you understand and agree to what is scripted in .envrc (as well as
invoked scripts from it), allow it for direnv:
```
direnv allow
```

And that is all, each time you will enter the directory where file
`.envrc` is, this script will automatically be loaded when entering it and
automatically unloaded when leaving it.
