# openstack
Export openstack variables for python openstackclient

## Description

Export variables `OS_*` required to be able to connect to openstack via
python openstack client.

`OS_*` variables are obtains with the `openrc.sh` file you can get from your
openstack instance.

Also setup a script to easily manage multiple openstack project within the
same directory. This is done directly in the `.envrc.ini` file using
`[openstack]` section to define the default project (used only during the
initialisation of the directory environment) then using
`[openstack:project_name]` section to configure per project openstack
variable.

The setup of the script is a symlink from `.direnv/src/select_openstack.sh`
to `.direnv/bin/select_openstack` allowing you to use command
`select_openstack`. This command will ask you which project you want to
activate.

If you want to hide some values in `.envrc.ini`, such as `OS_PASSWORD`, you
can start the value of this variable to `cmd:` followed by a command which
echo the content of the password. For instance `cmd:cat file_storing_os_password`

REMARK: There is not default value set for any `OS_*` variable.

Parameters in `.envrc.ini` are:

# Openstack module
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Manage openstack environment variable. Main section [openstack] have only one
# parameter `default` to define default openstack project configuration name.
# Use section of the form [openstack:project_config_name_1] to define variable
# per project configuration name.
# **REMARK**: VALUE OF `default` MUST BE THE SAME VALUE OF A SUBSECTION AS SHOWN
# BELOW:
